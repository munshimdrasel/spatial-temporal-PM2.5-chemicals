# spatial-temporal-PM2.5-chemicals
Spatial temporal PM2.5 chemical species in the United States

In this repository I've written codes to download IMPROVE/ EPA CSN/ EPA AQS data using  R 

To get started with AQS Data:

1. go to R folder
2. Run EPA_AQS_data_download.R file first 
    -you need to change working directory based on your pc
3. Run yearly_aqs_data_1999_2020.R file 
    -this file will combine both PM2.5 and it's chemical species
    -will convert daily data into monthly and yearly data
